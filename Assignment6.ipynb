    "# Question 1\n",
    "## Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a software programming model constructed around objects. This model compartmentalizes data into objects (data fields) and describes object contents and behavior through the declaration of classes (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP features include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Encapsulation*: This makes the program structure easier to manage because each object’s implementation and state are hidden behind well-defined boundaries.\n",
    "*Polymorphism*: This means abstract entities are implemented in multiple ways.\n",
    "*Inheritance*: This refers to the hierarchical arrangement of implementation fragments.\n",
    "Object-oriented programming allows for simplified programming. Its benefits include reusability, refactoring, extensibility, maintenance and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 2\n",
    "## List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modularity for easier troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with object-oriented programming languages, you know exactly where to look. “Oh, the car object broke down? The problem must be in the Car class!” You don’t have to muck through anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the beauty of encapsulation. Objects are self-contained, and each bit of functionality does its own thing while leaving the other bits alone. Also, this modality allows an IT team to work on multiple objects simultaneously while minimizing the chance that one person might duplicate someone else’s functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reuse of code through inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that in addition to your Car object, one colleague needs a RaceCar object, and another needs a Limousine object. Everyone builds their objects separately but discover commonalities between them. In fact, each object is really just a different kind of Car. This is where the inheritance technique saves time: Create one generic class (Car), and then define the subclasses (RaceCar and Limousine) that are to inherit the generic class’s traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, Limousine and RaceCar still have their unique attributes and functions. If the RaceCar object needs a method to “fireAfterBurners” and the Limousine object requires a Chauffeur, each class could implement separate functions just for itself. However, because both classes inherit key aspects from the Car class, for example the “drive” or “fillUpGas” methods, your inheriting classes can simply reuse existing code instead of writing these functions all over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you want to make a change to all Car objects, regardless of type? This is another advantage of the OO approach. Simply make a change to your Car class, and all car objects will simply inherit the new code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexibility through polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Riffing on this example, you now need just a few drivers, or functions, like “driveCar,” driveRaceCar” and “DriveLimousine.” RaceCarDrivers share some traits with LimousineDrivers, but other things, like RaceHelmets and BeverageSponsorships, are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where object-oriented programming’s sweet polymorphism comes into play. Because a single function can shape-shift to adapt to whichever class it’s in, you could create one function in the parent Car class called “drive” — not “driveCar” or “driveRaceCar,” but just “drive.” This one function would work with the RaceCarDriver, LimousineDriver, etc. In fact, you could even have “raceCar.drive(myRaceCarDriver)” or “limo.drive(myChauffeur).”\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Effective problem solving\n",
    "\n",
    "A language like C has an amazing legacy in programming history, but writing software in a top-down language is like playing Jenga while wearing mittens. The more complex it gets, the greater the chance it will collapse. Meanwhile, writing a functional-style program in a language like Haskell or ML can be a chore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is often the most natural and pragmatic approach, once you get the hang of it. OOP languages allows you to break down your software into bite-sized problems that you then can solve — one object at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 3\n",
    "## Differentiate between function and method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Method is called by its name, but it is associated to an object (dependent).\n",
    "A method is implicitly passed the object on which it is invoked.\n",
    "A method can operate on the data (instance variables) that is contained by the corresponding class\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Function is block of code that is also called by its name. (independent)\n",
    "The function can have different parameters or may not have any at all. If any data (parameters) are passed, they are passed explicitly.\n",
    "Function does not deal with Class and its instance concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 4\n",
    "## Define the following terms:\n",
    "## 1. Class\n",
    "A class is an entity that determines how an object will behave and what the object will contain. In other words, it is a blueprint or a set of instruction to build a specific type of object.\n",
    "## 2. Object\n",
    "An object is nothing but a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make a particular type of data useful. Object determines the behavior of the class. When you send a message to an object, you are asking the object to invoke or execute one of its methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a programming point of view, an object can be a data structure, a variable or a function. It has a memory location allocated. The object is designed as class hierarchies.\n",
    "## 3. Attribute\n",
    "Python attributes are of two types, instance attribute and class attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance attribute is a Python variable belonging to one, and only one, object. This variable is only accessible in the scope of this object and it is defined inside the constructor function, __init__(self,..) of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class attribute is a Python variable that belongs to a class rather than a particular object. It is shared between all the objects of this class and it is defined outside the constructor function, __init__(self,...), of the class.\n",
    "## 4. Behavior\n",
    "Behavior in Python means the way an object will be run based on the input provided by the user.\n",
    "\n"
